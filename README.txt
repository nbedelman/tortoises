got a vcf with a bunch of tortoise data from Evelyn.

main, overall goal is to find regions of the genome that are of hybrid origin.
I think i can do something like quibl...if I just look at the distribution of heterozygosity by rad-tag, in pure species it should looks something like an exponential because their parents (and on and on) are presumably from the same population. On the other hand, F1 hybrids should have a peaked distribution centering on the divergence time... I'll have to ask Michael to do it properly, but for now can just look at the distributions.
